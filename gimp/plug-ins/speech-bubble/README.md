Just enjoy it...

## Usage

Create a selection the size and shape of the intended speech bubble, then look
in the "Filters" menu under "Render". If all is well, there should be a menu
entry labeled "Speech Bubble". Choosing that will open a dialog asking for a
"Line Stroke Size". This is the number of pixels thick that the outline of the
resulting speech bubble will be.

That's about it.  Can't think of anything else right now.  Enjoy...
