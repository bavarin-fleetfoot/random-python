# Convenience Function Scripts

These are simple (and sometimes not so simple) python scripts which perform convenience functions.
Most of these scripts should be placed somewhere on your system path and marked as executable. (I place mine in my personal bin folder inside my home folder.) Each script will contain the license details in the initial docstring comment of that script.

 * urlopen - A simple python script for KDE users which will use 'kde-open' to open those pesky Windows .url files in your default web browser.
